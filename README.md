## GraphQL Toolbox

A set of [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/graphql) tools to help with GraphQL server and client development. 

### Getting Started

The prerequisites are [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html), [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

In order to run the server locally you need to execute following commands:  

```bash
$ npm install
$ sbt run
```

This will run the Play app in a dev mode which means that it will pick up all of the changes to a source code (it also includes resources managed by webpack).
